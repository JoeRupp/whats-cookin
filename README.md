# What's Cookin' 🍳

## Overview:

What's Cookin' is a Front-end group project from the Mod 2 curriculum at Turing School of Software & Design. Datasets for Users, Ingredients, and Recipes are retrieved from a RESTful API using fetch requests. This data is then manipulated through a series class to class interactions to be displayed to the DOM for users to interact with. The concepts introduced during the course of this project included Webpack, network requests/responses, and Test Driven Development.

## Set Up:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. `cd` into the repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the project dependencies.
4. Do not run `npm audit fix --force`. This will update to the latest version of packages. We need to be using `webpack-dev-server@3.11.2` which is not the latest version.
5. Run `npm start` to run the application. 
6. Open the site by copying and pasting the server location in your URL bar
  - The server location should look something like this --> http://localhost:8080

## Goals:
- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Make network requests to retrieve data
- Work with a local server and make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
- Refactor your code to DRY up repetitive logic
- Ensure your app follows best practices for accessibility
- Practice talking about your code and high level technical concepts
- Implement feedback to improve product and process.

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- Mocha/Chai
- CSS
- HTML
- VS Code & Atom
- Adobe illustrator
- Lighthouse
- WAVE evaluation tool (Chrome extension)

## Challenges:
- Search bar functionality of this application was difficult to implement due to the fact it had to be able to search by name or tag.
- Initial setup with class structure
- Pantry class integration
- Refactoring the code to separate the DOM manipulation into its own file  

## Wins:
- UX/UI layout
- Initial planning and design layout
- Fostering a collaborative team environment

## Future Additions:
- Add Drop down for all tags
- Better search functionality
- Add dyslexia accessibility button that toggles sites font to be reader friendly
