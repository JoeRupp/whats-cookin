# What's Cookin'

## Overview:

What's Cookin' is a Front-End project from the Mod 2 curriculum at Turing School of Software & Design. Given a URL that contained datasets for allUsers, allIngredients, and allRecipes we used the Fetch API to retrieve data and update the DOM. The concepts introduced during the course of this project included webpack, network requests and responses, and Test Driven Development.

## Set Up:
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. 'cd' into the repository
4. Run `npm install` in the CLI
5. Do not run `npm audit fix --force`. This will update to the latest version of packages. We need to be using `webpack-dev-server@3.11.2` which is not the latest version. If you start to run into Webpack errors, first check that all group members are using the correct version.
6. Run `npm start` in the CLI
7. Open the site by copying and pasting the server location in your URL bar
  - The server location should look something like this --> http://localhost:8080

## Goals:

- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Make network requests to retrieve data

The details of this project are outlined in the <a href="https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/What%27sCookin-PartOne.html" target="\__blank">project spec</a>.

## Tech used:
- JavaScript
- Mocha
- Chai
- CSS
- HTML
- VS Code & Atom
- Adobe illustrator

## Challenges:
- Search bar functionality of this application was difficult to implement due to the fact it had to be able to search by name or tag.
- Initial setup with class structure

## Wins:
- UX/UI layout
- Our initial planning and design layout set us up for success.

## Testing:
Mocha and chai are already set up, with a boilerplate test for you.

### Design Inspiration:
